# API Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fully integrate the Lifeline Smart Healthcare System frontend with the backend API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Client (`lib/api.ts`)

- Changed the base URL from `/api` to `http://localhost:5000` to directly communicate with the backend
- Maintained CORS handling for proper cross-origin requests
- Kept existing error handling and response parsing logic

### 2. Updated Authentication Context (`contexts/auth-context.tsx`)

- Updated the login method to use the correct `/auth/login` endpoint
- Updated the register method to use the correct `/auth/register` endpoint
- Ensured proper handling of API responses according to the backend documentation
- Maintained automatic login after successful registration

### 3. Updated Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)

- Removed complex rewrite rules that were causing conflicts
- Added proper CORS headers to handle cross-origin requests
- Simplified configuration for better maintainability

## Testing

The integration has been tested with:
- Successful user registration
- Successful user login
- Proper JWT token generation and handling
- Correct user role-based redirection

## Usage Instructions

1. Ensure the backend server is running on `http://localhost:5000`
2. Start the frontend development server with `npm run dev`
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`
4. Register a new user or log in with existing credentials
5. The application will automatically redirect based on user role

## Future Considerations

- Implement additional API endpoints as needed for full application functionality
- Add comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- Implement loading states for better user experience
- Add request caching where appropriate to improve performance
