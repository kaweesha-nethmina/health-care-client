# Doctor API Update

This document summarizes the update to match the actual API response format for the doctors endpoint.

## API Response Format

The actual API response for `GET /patients/doctors` is:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 2,
    "specialty": "Cardiology",
    "qualification": "MD, Board Certified",
    "schedule": "Monday-Friday: 9AM-5PM"
  }
]
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Doctor Interface
Updated the Doctor interface in `lib/services/patient-service.ts` to match the actual API response:

```typescript
// Doctor interface
export interface Doctor {
  id: number
  user_id: number
  specialty: string
  qualification: string
  schedule: string
  // Note: This matches the actual API response format
}
```

### 2. Updated Doctors Page Component
- Updated the Doctor interface in the doctors page component
- Updated mock data to match the actual API response format
- Modified the UI to display information based on available fields:
  - Display "Doctor {user_id}" instead of doctor name
  - Show specialty and qualification
  - Display schedule information
- Updated search functionality to search by specialty and qualification

### 3. Files Modified
1. `lib/services/patient-service.ts` - Updated Doctor interface
2. `app/patient/doctors/page.tsx` - Updated UI to match API response

## Implementation Notes

### Limitations
The current API response does not include:
- Doctor names
- Contact information (phone, email)
- Hospital information
- Rating information

### Future Enhancements
To improve the doctors listing page, the backend API could be enhanced to include:
1. Doctor names by joining with the users table
2. Contact information
3. Hospital affiliations
4. Rating/review information
5. Profile pictures

For now, the implementation works with the available data and provides patients with the ability to:
- Browse available doctors
- See doctor specialties and qualifications
- View doctor schedules
- Book appointments with doctors

## Verification
The doctors page now successfully fetches data from the API without errors and displays the information appropriately based on the actual API response format.
